# RadiographyClassifier
Basic radiography classifier on Covid, Pneumonia &amp; metastasis (opacity) I had lying around in my computer.

It uses a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) for x ray scans (radiography) of Covid-19, Pneumonia and Metastasis. It is fairly accurate for a hobby project, keeping in mind it was only trained to 3 epochs.

You can install all required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run the Jupyter Notebook.
